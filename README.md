<h1 align="center">Nextron ( Next.Js + Electron ) project boilerplate in TypeScript, with TailwindCSS + Shadcn/ui, web and desktop crossbuild</h1>

## Introduction
This repository is a Nextron ( Next.Js + Electron ) project template in TypeScript with a Next.Js 14 App Router that includes TailwindCSS and the Shadcn/ui component library. This project is also configured so that the application can be built for both web and desktop versions with the same code.

The aim of this project is to enable anyone to quickly and easily start up a project using these technologies.
## Installation
**How to create a new application with this template ?**  
There are two ways to create a new project with this template. This project uses and runs under Node 20, so it's advisable to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage and use the correct version of Node.
### Installation method 1 ( recommanded! ) :
To create a new project, use the command below :
```
# with npx
$ npx install-nextron-shadcn-boilerplate

# with yarn
$ SOON

# with pnpm
$ SOON
```
### Installation method 2 :
On GitHub, select this repository as a template.
### Installation method 3 :
To create a new project, just copy it by running :
```
git clone git@github.com:MaximePremont/boilerplate-nextron-shadcn.git
```
**Then, install depedencies by running `npm install` in the project folder.**
## Usage
### Run Next ( web application ) in dev mode :
You can use `npm run next:dev` to start a next web application in development mode with hot reload.
### Run Electron ( desktop application ) in dev mode :
You can use `npm run electron:dev` to start an electron desktop application in development mode with hot reload.
### Build & Start Next ( web application ) :
You can build your next web application by using `npm run next:build`. Then you can start it in production mode with `npm run next:start`.
### Build Electron ( desktop application ) :
You can build your Electron desktop application on different systems by using the commands bellow :
```
npm run electron:build-current        Build for current system
npm run electron:build-all            Build on all systems
npm run electron:build-win32          Build on Windows x32
npm run electron:build-win64          Build on Windows x64
npm run electron:build-linux          Build for linux*
npm run electron:build-mac            Build for MacOs**
npm run electron:build-mac-universal  Universal build for MacOs**
```
*For linux, you can change the package type ( snap, deb... ) by editing the [electron-builder.yml](./electron-builder.yml) file. You may need to install some packages ( for exemple rmp to build a `rpm`).

**MacOs versions can only be build using a Mac.

### Deployment to Vercel ( web application ) ###
To deploy your web application to Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Create a `vercel.json` file in your project root with the following configuration:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "yarn next:build",
  "outputDirectory": "renderer/.next",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "installCommand": "yarn install"
}
```

2. Push your code to your Git repository

3. Connect your repository to Vercel:
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js configuration
   - Click "Deploy"

Important Notes:
- The web version will be built using the `next:build` command
- Make sure any Electron-specific code is wrapped in environment checks
- Environment variables can be configured in the Vercel dashboard
- The web version will be served from the `renderer/.next` directory

### Cross-Platform Development Notes ###
When developing for both web and desktop platforms, keep these important considerations in mind:

1. **Environment-Specific Code:**
```typescript
// Example of environment-specific code wrapping
if (process.env.BUILD_TARGET === 'desktop') {
  // Electron-specific code here
} else {
  // Web-specific code here
}
```

2. **Native Dependencies:**
- Any native dependencies or Electron-specific features need to be:
  - Made conditional based on the platform
  - Provided with web alternatives
  - Or completely excluded from the web build

3. **Environment Variables:**
- Maintain separate environment configurations for:
  - Web deployment (Vercel dashboard)
  - Desktop development
  - Production builds
- Ensure all necessary variables are properly set in each environment

4. **Build Process:**
- The web build process is handled by Vercel
- Desktop builds use electron-builder
- Make sure your code can handle both build processes

### Deployment to binary ( desktop application ) ###
To build and distribute your desktop application, you have several options:

1. **Build for current platform:**
```bash
yarn electron:build-current
```
This will create a distributable for your current operating system.

2. **Build for specific platforms:**
```bash
# Windows (32-bit)
yarn electron:build-win32

# Windows (64-bit)
yarn electron:build-win64

# Linux
yarn electron:build-linux

# macOS
yarn electron:build-mac

# macOS Universal (Intel + Apple Silicon)
yarn electron:build-mac-universal
```

3. **Build for all platforms:**
```bash
yarn electron:build-all
```

Important Notes:
- The built applications will be available in the `dist` directory
- For macOS builds, you must build on a macOS system
- For Windows builds, you can build on any platform
- For Linux builds, you can customize the package type (deb, rpm, snap, etc.) in `electron-builder.yml`
- Make sure to test the built application before distribution
- Consider code signing for production releases

Distribution Options:
- Windows: `.exe` installer or portable executable
- macOS: `.dmg` or `.pkg` installer
- Linux: `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`, or `.snap` (configurable)

For more advanced distribution options, refer to the [electron-builder documentation](https://www.electron.build/).
